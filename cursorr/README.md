## About RecycloCart

RecycloCart makes recycling a lot easier. Using RecycloCart, people can get recyclable waste picked up from their homes or offices. This waste is sent to recycling industries which process and convert it into new products. The RecycloCart shop allows users to purchase these recycled items, helping to conserve our environment.

Users even receive token points for recycling waste, which can be used for discounts in the shop.
